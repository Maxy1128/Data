I can access gmbt-confluence links, but I was initially unable to log in. I followed the access tutorial to request permissions.

Step 1 was completed successfully: my personal account was added to the xxx group, and I can now log in.

In step 2, when creating a group access ticket for the required application group, the request failed with the following error (see attached screenshot):

After step 1, when I log in to Confluence, I see the message:



As a result, I can no longer view pages that were previously accessible.

Could you please help check the failed group access request and fix the permission issue, or add my account to the correct application group manually?

Thank you.
